# THP---Data-Scientist


## Project Overview

This repository contains a series of exercises completed during a Ruby training program.  
The project focuses on **learning Ruby fundamentals** and **applying them to simple data analysis use cases**, inspired by Data Scientist workflows.

The exercises progressively introduce core Ruby concepts and apply them to realistic datasets such as Twitter handles and cryptocurrency prices.

---

## Topics Covered

### Ruby Fundamentals
- User input (`gets`, `chomp`, `to_i`, `to_f`)
- Variables and basic data types
- Conditionals (`if`, `elsif`, `else`) *Yeah, trying to use elseif and it doesn't work D:*
- Loops (`times`, `while`, `each`, `upto`, `downto`)
- String manipulation (interpolation, slicing, formatting, repetition)
- Arrays (creation, iteration, sorting, filtering)
- Hashes (key-value structures, selection, aggregation)
- Method definition and code organization
- File organization with `require_relative` (*didn't use but discover in the ressource*)

## Data-Oriented Exercises

### Twitter Handle Analysis
Using a large array of real Twitter handles, the program performs several analyses:
- Counting elements
- Searching and filtering data
- Sorting alphabetically and by length
- Character-based analysis
- Data distribution using Hashes

---

### Cryptocurrency Analysis with Hashes
Using cryptocurrency names and prices:
- Data is structured into a Hash (`name => price`)
- Prices are converted to numeric types for reliable comparison
- The program identifies:
  - Highest and lowest values
  - Values under a given threshold
  - Ties (multiple results with the same value)

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and use core Ruby syntax confidently
- Manipulate collections (`Array`, `Hash`) efficiently
- Write readable and structured Ruby code
- Apply programming logic to real-world–inspired datasets
- Build a foundation for more advanced data-related projects
